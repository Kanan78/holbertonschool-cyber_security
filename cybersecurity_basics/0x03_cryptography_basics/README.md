# Cryptography Project

## Overview

This project introduces the fundamentals of **cryptography in cybersecurity**, focusing on core concepts, real-world applications, and practical tools commonly used by security professionals. The goal is to build a solid understanding of cryptographic principles and gain hands-on experience with widely used tools such as **OpenSSL**, **John the Ripper**, and **hashcat**.

## Requirements

### General

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All scripts will be tested on **Kali Linux**
* All scripts must be exactly **two lines long** (`wc -l file` should output `2`)
* You must substitute the IP range using `$1`
* All files must end with a new line
* The first line of every script must be exactly:

  ```
  #!/bin/bash
  ```
* A `README.md` file at the root of the project directory is mandatory
* You are not allowed to use backticks, `&&`, `||`, or `;`
* Code must follow the **Betty style** and will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
* All files must be executable

## Warning

Ensure consistent use of **lowercase notation** when referring to cryptographic algorithms (for example: `sha256`, not `SHA256`).
