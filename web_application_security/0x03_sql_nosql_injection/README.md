# Cyber Web Security Project: SQL & NoSQL Injection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding **SQL Injection (SQLi)** and **NoSQL Injection**, their differences, risks, and prevention techniques. It is based on the target `cyber_websec_0x01` and all exercises are performed in a controlled Kali Linux environment.

The goal of this project is to enable you to explain the concepts without relying on external resources.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Define **SQL Injection** and **NoSQL Injection**
- Explain the differences between SQL and NoSQL injections
- Identify the risks and impact of SQL Injections
- Describe **UNION attacks** and **Blind SQL Injection**
- Understand prevention methods including:
  - **Parameterized Queries**
  - **Stored Procedures**
  - **Input Validation**
  - **Escaping User Input**
  - **Using ORMs**
- Explain NoSQL injection in **MongoDB**
- Use **LIMIT** and **Regular Expressions** to prevent attacks
- Identify **NoSQL Injection Attack Vectors**
